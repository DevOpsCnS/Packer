    Commands to run:
    
        packer init az_windows.pkr.hcl
        packer validate az_windows.pkr.hcl
        packer build az_windows.pkr.hcl
        
**az_windows-docker.pkr.hcl**- This script is designed to install chocolatey and Docker on top of the standard Image provided by Azure. It provides a practical example of how to enhance a basic Image with additional software, offering a hands-on approach to configuring your server environment using Packer. This example demonstrates how to utilize variables within a file to execute a Packer build script.

    Commands to run:
    
        packer init az_windows-docker.pkr.hcl
        packer validate -var 'resourcegroup=<your resource group name>' az_windows-docker.pkr.hcl
